[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images)

Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

This plugin works by including all available image sizes for each image upload. Whenever WordPress outputs the image through the media uploader, or whenever a featured image is generated, those sizes will be included in the image tag via the [srcset](http://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/) attribute.

## Contribution Guidelines

Please submit pull requests to our dev branch. If your contribution requires such, please aim to include appropriate tests with your pr as well.

## Documentation

### For General Users

No configuration is needed! Just install the plugin and enjoy automatic responsive images!

### For Theme Developers

This plugin includes several functions that can be used by theme and plugin developers in templates.

### Advanced Image Compression

Advanced image compression is an experimental image editor that makes use of ImageMagick's compression setting to deliver deliver higher quality images at a smaller file sizes. As such, **ImageMagick is required for this feature to work**. To learn more about the actual compression settings being used, read Dave Newton's [excellent writeup at Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/efficient-image-resizing-with-imagemagick/).

To enable, place the following code in your `functions.php` file

```
function custom_theme_setup() {
	add_theme_support( 'advanced-image-compression' );
}
add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'custom_theme_setup' );
```

***Known issues:***
* Some people have encountered memory limits when uploading large files with the advanced image compression settings enabled (see [#150](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images/issues/150)).

### Function/Hook Reference

#### Function wp_get_attachment_image_srcset

`wp_get_attachment_image_srcset( $attachment_id, $size = 'medium', $image_meta = null )`

Retrieves the value for an image attachment's `srcset` attribute.

**Return:**
(string|bool) A `srcset` value string or false.

##### Parameters

**$attachment_id** (int)
Image attachment ID.

**$size** (array|string)
(Optional) Image size. Accepts any valid image size ('thumbnail', 'medium', etc.), or an array of width and height values in pixels (in that order). Default 'medium'.

**$image_meta** (array)
(Optional) The image meta data as returned by `wp_get_attachment_metadata()`. Default null.

##### Uses

`wp_calculate_image_srcset()`

?>

<img src="myimg.png"<?php echo $srcset; ?> sizes="{{custom sizes value}}">
```

##### Note

By default, the maximum width of images that are included in the `srcset` is 1600 pixels. You can override this default by adding a filter to `max_srcset_image_width`.

<?php
$image_meta = wp_get_attachment_metadata( 11 );
$image = wp_get_attachment_image_src( 11, 'medium' );
if ( $image ) {
	$image_src = $image[0];
	$size_array = array(
		absint( $image[1] ),
		absint( $image[2] )
	);
}
$srcset_value = wp_calculate_image_srcset( $size_array, $image_src, $image_meta );
$srcset = $srcset_value ? ' srcset="' . esc_attr( $srcset_value ) . '"' : '';
?>

<img src="myimg.png"<?php echo $srcset; ?> sizes="{{custom sizes value}}">
```

##### Note

By default, the maximum width of images that are included in the `srcset` is 1600 pixels. You can override this default by adding a filter to `max_srcset_image_width`.

### Backward Compatibility

The following filters are used for backward compatibility. If the described case is not applicable you may want to remove the filter from its hook.

#### data-sizes

Prior to version 2.5 a `srcset` and `data-sizes` attribute were added to the image while inserting the image in the content and we used a content filter to replace `data-sizes` by `sizes`. As from 2.5 both `srcset` and `sizes` are added to images using a content filter, but images that already have a `srcset` attribute are skipped. For this reason we still replace `data-sizes` by `sizes`.
If you did not use the plugin before version 2.5 or if you have removed `data-sizes` from your content you can remove the filter:

```
remove_filter( 'the_content', 'tevkori_replace_data_sizes' );
```

#### tevkori_get_sizes() $args param and filter

The deprecated function `tevkori_get_sizes()` had an `$args` param and a `tevkori_image_sizes_args` filter. To make those still work we added a shim. If you do not use `tevkori_get_sizes()` in your templates, or at least not pass an argument to the `$args` param, and if you don't use the deprecated `tevkori_image_sizes_args` filter hook, you can remove the filter:

```
remove_filter( 'wp_calculate_image_sizes', '_tevkori_image_sizes_args_shim', 1, 5 );
```

#### wp_get_attachment_image_sizes filter

In version 3.0 we introduced a new filter: `wp_get_attachment_image_sizes`. In version 3.1 this has been replaced by `wp_calculate_image_sizes`. If you don't use the `wp_get_attachment_image_sizes` filter you can remove the filter that has been added for backward compatibility:

```
remove_filter( 'wp_calculate_image_sizes', 'wp_get_attachment_image_sizes_filter_shim', 10, 5 );
```

---

### Dependencies

The only external dependency included in this plugin is [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) - v3.0.1. If you would like to remove Picturefill (see notes about [browser support](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/#support)), add the following to your functions.php file:

    function mytheme_dequeue_scripts() {
      wp_dequeue_script('picturefill');
    }

    add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'mytheme_dequeue_scripts');

We use a hook because if you attempt to dequeue a script before it's enqueued, wp_dequeue_script has no effect. (If it's still being loaded, you may need to specify a [priority](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action).)
