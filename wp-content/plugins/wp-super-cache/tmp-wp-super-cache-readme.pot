msgid "Mod_Rewrite. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve \"supercached\" static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are \"lighter\". This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file. Visits by anonymous or unknown users will be served this way."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description list item.
msgid "PHP. Supercached static files can now be served by PHP. The plugin will serve a \"supercached\" file if it exists and it's almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It's easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn't need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode. Your server may not cope as well with a really large amount of traffic. (You're gaming Digg aren't you? You'll need mod_rewrite, the rest of us are ok with PHP!)"
msgstr ""

#. Found in description list item.
msgid "Legacy caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users. These are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It's the most flexible caching method but also the slowest. As each page is different it's often better not to cache pages for these users at all and avoid legacy caching. Legacy caching will also cache visits by unknown users if this caching mode is selected. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too."
