See which plugins are slowing down your site.  This plugin creates a performance report for your site.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a profile of your WordPress site's plugins' performance by measuring their impact on your site's load time.  Often times, WordPress sites load slowly because of poorly configured plugins or because there are so many of them. By using the P3 plugin, you can narrow down anything causing slowness on your site.

This plugin uses the canvas element for drawing charts and requires requires Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, or IE9 or later.  This plugin will not work in IE8 or lower.

== Screenshots ==

1. First, profile your site.  The scanner generates some traffic on your site and monitors your site's performance on the server, then shows you the results. With this information, you can decide what action to take.
2. After profiling, you'll see a breakdown of relative runtime for each plugin.
3. Callouts at the top give you quick information like how much load time (in seconds) is dedicated to plugins and how many database queries your site is running per page.
4. The detailed timeline gives you timing information for every plugin, the theme, and the core for every page during the profile.  Find out exactly what's happening on slow loading pages.
5. You can toggle each series on and off to customize this timeline for your precise needs.
6. The query timeline gives you the number of database queries for every page during the profile.  Find out which pages generate the most database queries.
7. Keep a history of your performance scans, compare your current performance with your previous performance.
8. Full in-app help documentation
9. Send a summary of your performance profile via e-mail.  If you want to show your developer, site admin, hosting support, or a plugin developer what's going on with your site, this is good way to start the conversation.
10. Use the advanced settings to activate debug mode, control cache busting, or lock down profiling to a set of IP addresses.
11. View the debug log on the help page to help troubleshoot if P3 isn't recording properly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed P3, what now? =

Open the **Tools** menu, then open **P3 Plugin Profiler** then click **Scan Now**.

= What if I get a warning about usort()? =

Warning messages like this: `Warning: usort() [function.usort]: Array was modified by the user comparison function` are due to a known php bug.  See [php bug #50688](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=50688) for more information.  This warning does not affect the functionality of your site and it is not visible to your users.

= In the e-mail report, why is my theme detected as "unknown?" =

Previous version of the plugin (before 1.1.0) did not have theme name detection support.  If you performed a scan with a previous version, then upgraded to 1.1.0+ to view the scan, the theme name will show as "unknown."

= How do I get support for P3? =

We love to make P3 better.  When reporting a bug, please visit this page so we can get more information:  [http://x.co/p3support](http://x.co/p3support)

Thanks!

= Help!  I used P3 and now my site is down! =

First, get your site back up!  There are two ways to do this.  Try the emergency shutoff switch first.  If that doesn't work, delete the plugin files.

Emergency Shutoff Switch

1. Visit yoursite.com/wordpress/index.php?P3_SHUTOFF=1

Delete the Plugin Files

1. Delete wp-content/plugins/p3-profiler (the whole folder)
2. Delete wp-content/mu-plugins/p3-profiler.php (if it exists)

This can happen if P3 hits the memory limit on your server while it's running.  This happens most often on sites with many active plugins or a complex theme.  Consider switching to the Twenty Eleven theme or deactivating a few plugins before re-running P3.

= I get "Warning: file_put_contents( .... )" =

Please check your media settings.  This is in Settings -> Media -> Store uploads in this folder.  If this folder is not set correctly, P3 won't know where to read the files.

= How do I use P3 with multisite? =

P3 is available on the Tools menu for each site in the network.

= How can I change the list of pages scanned with auto-scan? =

You can write a plugin to hook the `p3_automatic_scan_urls` filter.  Here's some sample code:

<code>
function my_p3_auto_scan_pages() {
	return array(
		'http://example.com/',
		'http://example.com/some-cool-post',
		'http://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php',
	);
}
add_filter( 'p3_automatic_scan_urls', 'my_p3_auto_scan_pages' );
</code>
