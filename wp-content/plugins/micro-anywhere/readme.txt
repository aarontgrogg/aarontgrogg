Micro Anywhere allows for easy insertion of microformatted contact information and event details through the wordpress WYSIWYG editor.

== Description ==

Micro Anywhere is designed to allow anyone to make use of microformats on their blog, even if they don't know what microformats are. 

When the plugin is activated it adds two buttons to the Wordpress WYSIWYG editor -- one to insert event (calendar) data, and one to insert contact information (vCard) data. Each button opens an easy to use dialog box that prompts the user for information about their event or contact, and then outputs a human readable paragraph, fully marked up with a relevant microformat. When possible, relevant HTML tags are used to make interacting with the event easier. For example, if a URL is given, the event or contact's name becomes a link to that URL.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are microformats =

Microformats are a way of adding some extra HTML code to the content of a web page so that computer programs can understand what the information is about. For example, Micro Anywhere uses the hCalendar and hCard microformats to ensure computer programs viewing your site can recognize and use events and contact information you post. For more information on microformats, see [Microformats.org](http://www.microformats.org)

= I edited the event, and now the microformated contact doesn't seem to work. How can I fix it? =

Because most of the code that makes microformats work is hidden from the visual editing view, it's easy to delete something that's important without realizing it. To ensure that your microformated content works correctly, always edit it by putting the cursor inside the content you want to edit and clicking the Calendar or Contact Info button, and editing the information you want to change in the dialog box. This will ensure the microformated data continues to work correctly. If you do break the microformat, simply edit it as normal and fix the broken field... the plugin will fix the code when you hit "insert".

= What do you spend the donations on? =

Food, cloths, rent, etc. I'm a full time website designer and developer, but I didn't get paid for creating this plugin. If you like it, I'd appreciate any donations!

= What else do you have planned? =

1. Add support for more microformats, such as hReview.
1. Improving the interface so it's easier to use. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! Send them to bugs[at]undergroundwebdesigns.com
1. Possibly doing some work to automatically incorporate microformats into other areas of the blog, such as the footer or a "contact us" page.
