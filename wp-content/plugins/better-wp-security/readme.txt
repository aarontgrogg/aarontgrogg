== Description ==

= #1 WORDPRESS SECURITY PLUGIN =

Better WP Security takes the best WordPress security features and techniques and combines them in a single plugin thereby ensuring that as many security holes as possible are patched without having to worry about conflicting features or the possibility of missing anything on your site.

With one-click activation for most features as well as advanced features for experienced users Better WP Security can help protect any site.

= Professional Installation and Support Now Available =

Need help or want to make sure your setup is as secure as possible? Professional support is now available! <a href="http://fooplugins.com/plugins/better-wp-security/">Purchase support or installation today through our partner FooPlugins</a>

= Obscure =

As most WordPress attacks are a result of plugin vulnerabilities, weak passwords, and obsolete software. Better WP Security will hide the places those vulnerabilities live keeping an attacker from learning too much about your site and keeping them away from sensitive areas like login, admin, etc.

* Remove the meta "Generator" tag
* Change the urls for WordPress dashboard including login, admin, and more
* Completely turn off the ability to login for a given time period (away mode)
* Remove theme, plugin, and core update notifications from users who do not have permission to update them
* Remove Windows Live Write header information
* Remove RSD header information
* Rename "admin" account
* Change the ID on the user with ID 1
* Change the Wordpress database table prefix
* Change wp-content path
* Removes login error messages
* Display a random version number to non administrative users anywhere version is used

= Protect =

Just hiding parts of your site is helpful but won't stop everything. After we hide sensitive areas of the sites we'll protect it by blocking users that shouldn't be there and increasing the security of passwords and other vital information.

* Scan your site to instantly tell where vulnerabilities are and fix them in seconds
* Ban troublesome bots and other hosts
* Ban troublesome user agents
* Prevent brute force attacks by banning hosts and users with too many invalid login attempts
* Strengthen server security
* Enforce strong passwords for all accounts of a configurable minimum role
* Force SSL for admin pages (on supporting servers)
* Force SSL for any page or post (on supporting servers)
* Turn off file editing from within Wordpress admin area
* Detect and block numerous attacks to your filesystem and database

= Detect =

Should all the protection fail Better WP Security will still monitor your site and report attempts to scan it (automatically blocking suspicious users) as well as any changes to the filesystem that might indicate a compromise.

* Detect bots and other attempts to search for vulnerabilities
* Monitor filesystem for unauthorized changes

= Recover =

Finally, should the worst happen Better WP Security will make regular backups of your WordPress database (should you choose to do so) allowing you to get back online quickly in the event someone should compromise your site.

* Create and email database backups on a customizable schedule

= Other Benefits =

* Make it easier for users to log into a site by giving them login and admin URLs that make more sense to someone not accustomed to WordPress
* Detect hidden 404 errors on your site that can affect your SEO such as bad links, missing images, etc.

= Compatibility =

* Works on multi-site (network) and single site installations
* Works with Apache, LiteSpeed or NGINX (NGINX will require you to manually edit your virtual host configuration)
* Some features can be problematic if you don't have enough RAM to support them. All my testing servers allocate 128MB to WordPress and usually don't have any other plugins installed. I have seen issues with file check and database backups failing on servers with 64MB or less of RAM, particularly if there are many other plugins being used.

= Warning =

Please read the installation instructions and FAQ before installing this plugin. It makes some significant changes to your database and other site files which, without a proper backup, can cause problems if something goes wrong. While problems are rare, most (not all) support requests I get for this plugin involve the users failure to make a proper backup before installing.

== Installation ==

Don't want to configure Better WP Security yourself but still want to make sure your site is secure as possible? <a href="http://fooplugins.com/plugins/better-wp-security/" target="_blank">Purchase premium installation and configuration for Better WP Security</a>

1. Backup your Wordpress database, config file, and .htaccess file
2. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Unzip
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Visit the Better security menu for checklist and options

NOTE: It is possible that something will break due to the complexity of the changes made by this plugin. That said, under no circumstances do I release this plugin with any warranty, implied or otherwise, and at no time will I take any responsibility for any damage that might arise from the use of this plugin. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS BACKUP BEFORE TRYING NEW SOFTWARE!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does Better WP Security require WordPress the latest WordPress version? Can't I use a slightly older version? =
* One of the best practices a WordPress site owner can do to keep their site secure is to keep your software up to date. Because of this fact I do not test this plugin in anything but the latest stable version of WordPress and will only guarantee it works in the latest version.

= Will this completely stop all attacks on my site? =
* Of course not. Better WP Security is designed to help improve the security of your WordPress installation from many common attack methods. It can no way prevent every possible attack on your website. Nothing replaces diligence and good practice. This plugin just makes it a little easier for you to apply both.

= Is "one-click" protection good enough? =
* While one-click protection will go a long way to helping reduce the risk of attack on your site, the more features you can activate the better off you are. If you have a plugin or theme that conflicts with a feature of Better WP Security then just turn off the offending feature. It is better to use as much as you can than to not use anything at all.

= Is this only for new sites or can I use it on existing sites too? =
* Many of the changes made by this plugin are complex and can break existing sites. While it can be installed in either a new or existing site I cannot stress enough the importance of making a backup of your existing site before applying any of the options in this plugin.

= Will this work on all servers and hosts? =
* Better WP Security requires Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX to work.
* While this plugin should work on all hosts with Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX it has been known to experience problems in shared hosting environments where it runs out of resources such as available CPU or RAM. For this reason it is extremely important that you make a backup of your site before installing on any existing site as, if you run out of resources during an operation such as renaming your database table, you may need your backup to be able to restore access to your site.
* Finally, please make sure you have adequate RAM if you plan to use the file change detector of make large backups.

= Are you still developing this plugin? =
* Yes. I use this plugin on every site I build and as such will continue to develop it for the foreseeable future.

= Does this work with netowork or multisite installations? =
* Yes.

= Can I help? =
* Of course! I am in constant need of testers and I would be more than happy to add the right contributor. In addition, I could always use help with translations for internationalization. <a href="http://bit51.com/contributing-to-better-wp-security/">For more information on contributing to Better WP Security visit Bit51</a>.

= Will this break my site? =
* It is possible that something will break. That said, under no circumstances do I release this plugin with any warranty, implied or otherwise, and at no time will I take any responsibility for any damage that might arise from the use of this plugin. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS BACKUP BEFORE TRYING NEW SOFTWARE!
* Note that renaming the wp-content directory will not update the path in existing content. Use this feature only on new sites or in a situation where you can easily update all existing links.

= I've enabled the Enforce SSL option and it broke my site. How do I get back in? =
* Open your wp-config.php file in a text editor and remove the following 2 lines:
* define('FORCE_SSL_LOGIN', true);
* define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);

= Where can I get help if something goes wrong? =
* Free support is available by reading the <a href="http://bit51.com/software/better-wp-security/" target="_blank">plugin documentation</a> or may be available with the help of the community in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-wp-security" target="_blank">WordPress.org support forums</a> (this is community provided support as Bit51 does not monitor the WordPress.org support forums).
