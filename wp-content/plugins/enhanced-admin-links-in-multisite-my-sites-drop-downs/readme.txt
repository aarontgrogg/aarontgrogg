Enhanced Admin Links in Multisite 'My Sites' Drop-Downs

== Description ==

Another WordPress plug-in that started with me finding something to be annoying,
finding a way to fix it, then figuring if it made my life a little better,
someone else might appreciate it too...

Currently, in a multisite installation, when in Admin mode, in order get to the
'Posts', 'Pages', 'Themes', 'Plugins', 'Settings', or 'Tools' page for a site,
before you can finally click the admin link you really wanted.

I never understood why those drop-downs were so limited.  So I added to them.

This plug-in adds links for 'Posts', 'Pages', 'Themes', 'Plugins', 'Settings', and 'Tools',
to the 'Network Admin' and individual Site drop-downs, making jumping between
multisite options a **lot** easier...
*Note that there is no 'Posts', 'Pages', or 'Tools' page available in the 'Network Admin' section,
so those admin links are not added.*

Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/thoughts,

== Installation ==

1. Download the ZIP
2. Unzip the ZIP
3. Copy/paste the unzipped files into your WP plug-in directory (`/wp-content/plugins/`)
4. From within WP's Plugin Admin panel, Activate the plug-in
5. Enjoy the fewer clicks this simple plugin brings to your life...


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What links are added?  =
* Currently, it is a fixed set: 'Themes', 'Plugins', 'Settings', and 'Tools'.  If there is enough demand,
  I could build an admin page, but it seems like overkill right now...  Note that 'Tools' is **not** a valid
  page in the 'Network Admin' section, so it is not added to that drop-down.


== Screenshots ==

1. Before screenshot of the Network Admin drop-down expanded, displaying the normal admin links.
2. After screenshot of the Network Admin drop-down expanded, with the new links added, but no 'Tools' link.
3. After screenshot of a Site drop-down expanded, with the new links added, including 'Tools'.
