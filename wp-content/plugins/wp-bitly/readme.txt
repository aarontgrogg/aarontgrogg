Use Bitly generated shortlinks for all your WordPress posts and pages, including custom post types.


== Description ==

WP Bitly is the easiest way to replace the internally generated WordPress shortlinks with Bitly generated shortlinks. Even [WPBeginner](http://www.wpbeginner.com/blueprint/wp-bitly/) uses it (this isn't an endorsement from them, I found the article almost by accident)!

Provide WP Bitly with an authorization token (automatically generated for you by Bitly), tell it which post types you'd like to generate shortlinks for, and forget about it! WP Bitly does the rest for you.

Shortlinks are a great way to quickly share posts on social media like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Just finished writing an amazing post and want to share that post with your friend? It's a lot easier to text message a shortlink than the entire address.

WP Bitly also provides some insights (via a metabox on your edit post screen) as to how your link is being passed around, and who's clicking on it.

* More feedback from Bitly on how your link is generating leads
* Feature Requests are welcome via the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-bitly)

= This Plugin is GPL =

*Someone out there is selling a plugin with the exact same name as WP Bitly. Just to be clear, it is not the same plugin. This plugin is open source and free, and will remain so forever.


== Installation ==

= Upgrading =

Older versions of WP Bitly used a beta API provided by Bitly that required a username and API key. The more recent versions of WP Bitly use the V3 Bitly API which only requires a single OAuth token to generate short links.

You will need to upgrade from the WordPress dashboard, and navigate to the *Dashboard >> Settings >> Writing* page to add your new OAuth Token if you're coming from a version prior to 2.0.

= Add New Plugin =

1. From the *Dashboard* navigate to *Plugins >> Add New*
2. Enter "WP Bitly" in the search field
3. Select *Install Now*, click *OK* and finally *Activate Plugin*
4. This will return you to the WordPress Plugins page. Find WP Bitly in the list and click the *Settings* link to configure.
5. Enter your OAuth token, and that's all! You're done!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installation, do I need to update all my posts for short links to be created? =

No. The first time a shortlink is requested for a particular post, WP Bitly will automatically generate one.

= What happens if I change a posts permalink? =

WP Bitly will verify the shortlink when it's requested and update as necessary all on its own.

= Can I include the shortlink directly in a post? =

Sure can! Just use our handy dandy shortcode `[wpbitly]` and shazam! The shortcode accepts all the same arguments as the_shortlink(). You can also set "post_id" directly if you wish.

= How do I include a shortlink using PHP? =

`<?php wpbitly_shortlink(); // shortcode shweetness. ?>`

*(You don't have to include the php comment, but you can if you want.)*
