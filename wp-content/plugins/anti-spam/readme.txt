== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Anti-spam plugin work? =

Two extra hidden fields are added to comments form. First field is the question about the current year. Second field should be empty.
If the user visits site, than first field is answered automatically with javascript, second field left blank and both fields are hidden by javascript and css and invisible for the user.
If the spammer tries to submit comment form, he will make a mistake with answer on first field or tries to submit an empty field and spam comment will be automatically rejected.

= How to test what spam comments are rejected? =

You may enable sending all rejected spam comments to admin email.
Edit [anti-spam.php](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php) file and find "$antispam_send_spam_comment_to_admin" and make it "true".

= Does Anti-spam plugin work with Jetpack Comments? =

Anti-spam plugin does not work with [Jetpack Comments](http://jetpack.me/support/comments/).
Jetpack Comments use iframe to insert comment form and it is impossible to access it via javascript because of security reasons.
If you use Jetpack Comments - you should find some other plugin to block spam.
You could try [Akismet](http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/), it is compatible with Jetpack Comments.

= Does Anti-spam plugin work with ajax comments forms? =

Some themes, for example [p2](http://wordpress.org/themes/p2), use ajax to submit comment.
But if the script of the theme will not submit extra Anti-spam fields - so Anti-spam plugin will not work.

= What is the percentage of spam blocked? =

Anti-spam plugin blocks about 99.9% of automatic spam messages (sent by spam-bots via post requests). 
But Anti-spam plugin will pass the messages which were submitted by spammers manually via browser. But such messages happens very rarely.

= What about trackback spam? =

Users rarely use trackbacks because it is manual and requires extra input. Spammers uses trackbacks because it is easy to cheat here.
Users use pingbacks very often because they work automatically. Spammers does not use pingbacks because backlinks are checked.
So trackbacks are blocked by default but pingbacks are enabled. You may enable trackbacks if you use it.
Edit [anti-spam.php](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php) file and find "$antispam_allow_trackbacks" and make it "true".
You may read more about the [difference between trackbacks and pingbacks](http://web-profile.com.ua/web/trackback-vs-pingback/).

= And one more thing... =

If site has caching plugin enabled and cache is not cleared or if theme does not use 'comment_form' action - Anti-spam plugin does not worked. So in new version of the plugin now whole input added via javascript if it does not exist in html of the comments form.

= Not enough information about the plugin? =

You may check out the [source code of the plugin](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php).
The plugin has about 100 lines of code and pretty easy to read. I was trying my best to make plugin's code clean.
Plugin is small but it makes all the dirty work against spam pretty good. You may give it a try.

= How to reduce the amount of spam? =

Do not order spam-newsletters because people hate spam and people will not like products received from spam.
Do not order products from spam. If spam will be less effective than spammers will stop sending it.
