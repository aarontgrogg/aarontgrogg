				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>Dynamic Tech Lead with over 13 years experience building websites.  Proven track record of clean, efficient, dependable products.  An addiction to "what's new" in web technology (key focus on HTML, JavaScript and CSS).  Highly proficient in researching, testing, implementing, mentoring, and serving as a technology advocate.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="skills">
				<h1>Skills &amp; Abilities</h1>
				<p>I start with clean, compliant, cutting-edge <strong>HTML</strong>. I add <strong>CSS</strong> to make it look just like the design.  Then I sprinkle a little <strong>JavaScript</strong> magic to make it dance...</p>
				<p>I <strong>hand-code</strong> and focus on <strong>high performance</strong> at all times, utilizing as many of Steve Souders' techniques as I possibly can.  I always try to make IE happy, but am not afraid to let it look simpler, if that helps performance.  <strong>JSON</strong> is a good friend of mine, we hang out a lot.  I also like his friends <strong>Closure</strong> and <strong>OOJS</strong>.  And when I want to really nerd-out, I spend time with <strong>Microformats</strong>.</p>
				<p>I excel at <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>, including custom-fields and -database interaction (check-out my Theme and Plug-ins below).  I <em>actually enjoy</em> working with designers, back-end developers and third-party vendors.  I'm also extremely well-versed in working on multiple projects simultaneously.</p>

			<section class="portfolio">
				<h1>Portfolio</h1>
				<h2>People.com: http://www.people.com/</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Tablet-optimized website (still in development):</h3>
						<p>
							A new version of People.com, optimized for touch-devices, including frame-like sections, swiping from section-to-section, interactive content, rich media, and curated search.  The goal of this is to improve the user experience on touch devices and hopefully integrate such interactivity in the full website.<br />
							Site is still in development, link to development-version of JS:<br />
							<a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/j/tablet/main.js">http://www.people.com/people/static/j/tablet/main.js</a>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Incorporate all JS into single file to reduce HTTP Requests</li>
							<li>jQuery + plug-ins to integrate custom swipability on touch and desktop devices</li>
							<li>Tablet-oriented project scope allowed for -webkit-transitions &amp; -transforms in place of JavaScript animations, but also works in desktop WebKit browsers</li>
							<li>Caching of variables/elements for improved performance</li>
							<li>Ajax content &amp; images for fast page load</li>
							<li>Use of "#" for deep-linking</li>
							<li>Dynamic ad loading and refreshing</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>2011 Academy Awards interactive second-screen trivia game:</h3>
						<p>
							During the Awards show, users received "Fun Facts" and trivia questions in-synch with the show as it happened.  The goal was to improve brand exposure and increase user-base tie-in with event.  Traffic was fair, but suffered from the limited browser scope; functionality is being added this year to open it to all browsers.<br />
							Site is visible only during event, link to JS:<br />
							<a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/j/package/redcarpet2011/secondscreen.js">http://www.people.com/people/static/j/package/redcarpet2011/secondscreen.js</a>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Incorporate all JS into single file to reduce HTTP Requests</li>
							<li>Object-oriented JS</li>
							<li>JSON/P</li>
							<li>jQuery</li>
							<li>WebKit-only project scope allowed for -web-kit transitions &amp; -transforms in place of JavaScript animations</li>
							<li>Caching of variables/elements for improved performance</li>
							<li>Use of cookies to track game status &amp; score</li>
							<li>Polling feature for synching of content publishing</li>
							<li>Use of CSS classes to drive "state" of game, reducing JS/DOM interaction</li>
							<li>Ajax content</li>
							<li>Dynamic ad and tracking loading and refreshing, including video ads during commercials</li>
							<li>Oversaw development of, and integration with, custom CMS</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Photo gallery "Ajaxification":</h3>
						<p>
							Converted page-refresh gallery into Ajax-refreshed gallery. The goal was to increase page views and improve user immersion.  This project has been dramatically successful, increasing page views from ___ to ___, and has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.<br />
							Example: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/gallery/0,,20538782,00.html">http://www.people.com/people/gallery/0,,20538782,00.html</a><br />
							JS: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/j/photos/gallery.js">http://www.people.com/people/static/j/photos/gallery.js</a>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Object-oriented JS</li>
							<li>JSON/P</li>
							<li>jQuery</li>
							<li>Caching of variables/elements for improved performance</li>
							<li>Galleries are build to function without JS, via full page refresh, but progressively-enhanced if JS is available</li>
							<li>Ajax content &amp; images for fast page refresh</li>
							<li>Use of "#" for deep-linking</li>
							<li>Dynamic recirc, ad and tracking loading and refreshing</li>
							<li>Integration with social linking</li>
							<li>Implementation of Tagging Tool (see below)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Photo gallery Tagging Tool:</h3>
						<p>
							Built custom CMS to allow editorial staff to create "hot spots" &amp; images zooms for gallery images.  Also created JS retrieval and implementation of the hot spot tags.  The goal was to improve user immersion and, with limited editorial use, it has been successful.  This work has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.
							Custom CMS is behind log-in, link to example use and JS:
							Example: <a href="http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/package/gallery/0,,20449766_20466837,00.html">http://www.peoplestylewatch.com/people/stylewatch/package/gallery/0,,20449766_20466837,00.html</a><br />
							JSON/P: <a href="http://storage.people.com/people/photo/js/20917547.js">http://storage.people.com/people/photo/js/20917547.js</a><br />
							JS: <a 	href="http://www.people.com/people/static/j/photos/gallery.js">http://www.people.com/people/static/j/photos/gallery.js</a>, Find <code>addtags</code>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Object-oriented JS</li>
							<li>JSON/P</li>
							<li>jQuery</li>
							<li>Caching of variables/elements for improved performance</li>
							<li>Allow editorial staff to entire gallery slide URL</li>
							<li>Ajax image from specific slide, displaying in-page</li>
							<li>Staff can drag over image to create hot-spot</li>
							<li>Then enter content for that hot-spot to reveal, such as headline, deck, and image URLs</li>
							<li>Clicking Save creates JSON/P file on server</li>
							<li>Above gallery JS fetches JSON/P and adds interactivity to page</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Photo gallery "stitching":</h3>
						<p>
							Allows editorial staff to "stitch together" several galleries, so, as a user gets to the end of one gallery, the "Next" button takes them straight to another editorially-associated gallery.  The goal was to increase page views and improve user immersion.  This work is used frequently and has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.<br />
							Example: Stitching changes regularly, no consistent example URL<br />
							JSON/P: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/gallery/stitches/json/0,,20466837,00.js">http://www.people.com/people/gallery/stitches/json/0,,20466837,00.js</a><br />
							JS: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/j/photos/gallerystitch.js">http://www.people.com/people/static/j/photos/gallerystitch.js</a>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Object-oriented JS</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Twitter widget:</h3>
						<p>
							Dynamic widget that can be placed on any page, fed various feed parameters, and display the desired number of tweets from various people followed by People.com.  To get around Twitter's max-hits-per-hour, created an in-house fetch-and-cache system (details below).  The goal was to increase user immersion.  This widget has been successful and has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.<br />
							Example: <a href="http://www.people.com/">http://www.people.com/</a><br />
							JSON/P: <a href="http://img2-short.timeinc.net/people/static/json/twitter/main.js">http://img2-short.timeinc.net/people/static/json/twitter/main.js</a><br />
							JS: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/j/twitter/twitter.js">http://www.people.com/people/static/j/twitter/twitter.js</a>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Object-oriented JS</li>
							<li>JSON/P</li>
							<li>jQuery</li>
							<li>Caching of variables/elements for improved performance</li>
							<li>Allow editorial staff to create Lists of Followers within Twitter</li>
							<li>Built WordPress interface that fetches the feeds from Twitter and creates JSON/P files</li>
							<li>JSON/P files are cached every 10-15 minutes from WordPress onto People.com servers</li>
							<li>Cached JSON/P files are Ajaxed into page</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Performance optimizations and site enhancements:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Added HTML5 Boilerplate recommendations, where possible
								<ul>
									<li>HTML5 DOCTYPE</li>
									<li>IE-Conditional Comments around <code>&lt;html&gt;</code></li>
									<li>Custom Modernizr</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Rewrote all of site CSS<br /><a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/c/main.css">http://www.people.com/people/static/c/main.css</a><br />
								Home-page CSS: <a href="http://www.people.com/people/static/c/home/main.css">http://www.people.com/people/static/c/home/main.css</a>
								<ul>
									<li>Researched declarations to determine if still needed and where it is used</li>
									<li>Removed no-longer-used declarations</li>
									<li>Moved lesser-used declarations to unique files</li>
									<li>Introduced CSS reset to global CSS file</li>
									<li>Rewrote remaining declarations to reduce selector specificity and removed declarations made obsolete by reset</li>
									<li>Replaced numerous images with CSS3 declarations, retaining image declarations for fallback</li>
									<li>Converted numerous images to sprites, storing as PNG8s</li>
									<li>Converted existing GIF sprites to PNG8s</li>

					<li>A UX Test Kitchen client, this award-winning site is one of my most treasured productions.  Not only is the client's cause a fantastic one, but it is a client that I wasn't able to help during a college course, and, well, it's just an absolutely gorgeous site.
