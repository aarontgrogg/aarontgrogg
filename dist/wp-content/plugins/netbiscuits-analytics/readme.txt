== Description ==

Mobile is the fastest-growing communication channel between you and your customers. Mobile Analytics offers an opportunity for brands to be far-reaching and relevant to how audiences consume content today.

Netbiscuits Mobile Analytics is unique because it's based on more than 8000 device profiles - both mobile and desktop - and 500 device-feature data points. Crucially, it also provides you with user context such as bandwidth speed, location and screen orientation - data which is not available in most other analytics tools. We've harnessed our extensive experience with mobile data to create unique dashboard reports which interpret real-time data into easy-to-digest insights. Our uniquely visual dashboards enable you to evaluate Traffic, Bounce and Conversion KPIs without the need for a Data Scientist or a background in analytics. No other analytics tools make it as easy or as clear to interpret your data.

This plug-in allows you to simply drop your Netbiscuits Mobile Analytics one-time tracking code snippet directly into your WordPress website and begin collecting data. View your own visualisations in minutes by visiting [my.netbiscuits.com](https://my.netbiscuits.com/) and see the insights provided by your web traffic.

The Netbiscuits Mobile Analytics plug-in requires you to sign up for a free account at [my.netbiscuits.com](https://my.netbiscuits.com/).

= What is Netbiscuits? =
* Netbiscuits Mobile Analytics is unique because it's based on more than 8000 device profiles - both mobile and desktop - and 500 device-feature data points. Crucially, it also provides you with user context such as bandwidth speed, location and screen orientation - data which is not available in most other analytics tools. We've harnessed our extensive experience with mobile data to create unique dashboard reports which interpret real-time data into easy-to-digest insights. Our uniquely visual dashboards enable you to evaluate Traffic, Bounce and Conversion KPIs without the need for a Data Scientist or a background in analytics. No other analytics tools make it as easy or as clear to interpret your data.

= Why is this different from other web analytics options? =
* Netbiscuits has been building a device database for over 14 years. Throughout that time, ensuring the quality and accuracy of our data has been of paramount importance. Based on this high-quality data we've pre-built categories into our product, making it easier to segment and report on key device groups including tablets, smartphones, feature phones, PCs, and Smart TVs. In a recent benchmark study against the leading databases used by competitors, we found they had error rates of between 30% and 90% in reporting of OS version and screen sizes. Poor data can be more harmful than no data. Always challenge your analytics vendor on where they get their mobile data and how they verify its accuracy.

= Can I use Netbiscuits Mobile Analytics alongside my current web analytics software? =
* Absolutely. Netbiscuits Mobile Analytics is an ideal complement to any other analytics product as it offers new data and unique insights into the highly diverse and complex web visitor landscape across tablets, smartphones, PCs, feature phones, Smart TVs, game consoles and more. You can also import Netbiscuits device data directly into your current solution for a more detailed and accurate report. However, we believe the uniquely visual and actionable dashboards we provide in our tool make it far more powerful to use both together.

= Why is it important to know your web traffic? =

= Where do I find my Analytics tracking code snippet? =
* First you need to register for a free account [here](https://my.netbiscuits.com/). It's quick, easy and we don't require any payment details. To obtain your code, you will need to [sign-in](https://my.netbiscuits.com/). From your first entry you will be presented with a screen to obtain your analytics code but you can also get it by visiting [the Detection Code page](https://my.netbiscuits.com/account-mgmt/detectioncode).

= I've activated the plugin, so why don't I see my analytics code yet? =
* The plugin simply enables you to drop the tracking code snippet seamlessly into your website. You need to obtain the tracking code via our website. See the above two answers for more details.

= Does Netbiscuits sample or delay my data? =
* Any code you add to a page will need to be loaded but as the code features at the bottom of the page, and is loaded asynchronously, it will not slow down the overall load time for the user.

= Will this code slowdown my site? =
* No, Netbiscuits web data is real-time and allows you to see your actual visitor data as it's coming in. Our Device Detection software can provide profiles on millions of visitors within 100 - 200 milliseconds and our web analytics tool delivers all your data within minutes of the traffic hitting your website. This makes it a powerful tool for A/B testing content and campaign changes to optimise your marketing results.

= What happens if I exceed my free periodic limits? =
* We will e-mail you to warn you and there will be notifications in your dashboard. Upon exceeding the monthly limit, you will no longer be able to see data for the rest of that month. However, we will continue to capture data so that when you upgrade, you can see all of the historic information.
