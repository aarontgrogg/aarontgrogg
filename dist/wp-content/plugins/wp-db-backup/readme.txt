== Installation ==
1. Extract the wp-db-backup/ folder file to /wp-content/plugins/
1. Activate the plugin at your blog's Admin -> Plugins screen
1. The plugin will attempt to create a directory /wp-content/backup-*/ inside your WordPress directory.
1. You may need to make /wp-content writable (at least temporarily) for it to create this directory. 
   For example:
   `$ cd /wordpress/`
   `$ chgrp www-data wp-content` (where "`www-data`" is the group your FTP client uses)
   `$ chmod g+w wp-content`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I restore my database from a backup? =

Briefly, use phpMyAdmin, which is included with most hosting control panels. More details and links to further explanations are [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Restoring_Your_Database_From_Backup).

= My backup stops or hangs without completing. =

If you edit the text of wp-db-backup.php in a text editor like Notepad, you’ll see around line 50 the following:

`/**
* Set MOD_EVASIVE_OVERRIDE to true
* and increase MOD_EVASIVE_DELAY
* if the backup stops prematurely.
*/
// define('MOD_EVASIVE_OVERRIDE', false);
define('MOD_EVASIVE_DELAY', '500');`

Do what it says: un-comment MOD_EVASIVE_OVERRIDE and set it to true like so:

`define('MOD_EVASIVE_OVERRIDE', true);`

That will slow down the plugin, and you can slow it even further by increasing the MOD_EVASIVE_DELAY number from 500.

Better yet, put the lines that define the `MOD_EVASIVE_OVERRIDE` and `MOD_EVASIVE_DELAY` constants in your wp-config.php file, so your settings don't get erased when you upgrade the plugin.

= What is wp-db-backup.pot for? =

This files is used by non-English users to translate the display into their native language.  Translators are encouraged to send me translated files, which will be made available to others here:

= Why are only the core database files backed up by default? =

Because it's a fairly safe bet that the core WordPress files will be successfully backed up.  Plugins vary wildly in the amount of data that they store.  For instance, it's not uncommon for some statistics plugins to have tens of megabytes worth of visitor statistics.  These are not exactly essential items to restore after a catastrophic failure.  Most poeple can reasonably live without this data in their backups.

== Usage ==
1. Click the Tools or Manage menu in your WordPress admin area.
1. Click the Backup sub-menu.

1. The plugin will look for other tables in the same database.  You may elect to include other tables in the backup.
  ** NOTE **
  Including other tables in your backup may substantially increase the size of the backup file!
  This may prevent you from emailing the backup file because it's too big.

1. Select how you'd like the backup to be delivered:
* Download to your computer : this will send the backup file to your browser to be downloaded
* Email : this will email the backup file to the address you specify

1. Click "Backup!" and your database backup will be delivered to you.

The filename of the backup file will be of the form
   DB_prefix_date.sql
DB = the name of your WordPress database, as defined in wp-config.php
prefix = the table prefix for this WordPress blog, as defined in wp-config.php
date = CCYYmmdd_B format:  20050711_039
       the "B" is the internet "Swatch" time.  
       See the PHP date() function for details.

When having the database backup emailed or sent to your browser for immediate download, the backup file will be _deleted_ from the server when the transfer is finished.
