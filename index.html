				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>
					Hi, my name is Aaron.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been working with the web since 1998.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a proven track record of clean, efficient, dependable products.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have an addiction to "what's new" in web technology (key focus on front-end development) and finding better ways to do something, and am highly proficient in researching, testing, implementing, mentoring, and serving as a technology advocate.
				</p>

			</section>

			<section id="skills">

				<h1>Skills &amp; Abilities</h1>
				<p>
					I start with carefully-crafted, mobile-first and responsive HTML, add CSS and JavaScript as needed, including jQuery, Ajax and JSON.  I'm also proficient with PHP, MySQL and WordPress.
				</p>
				<p>
					My focus is primarily on user experience and performance.  I try to make all browsers happy, but I am not afraid to let something look or behave simpler if that makes the overall experience better for the user.
				</p>

						<h3>Company website:</h3>
						<p>
							The company's first venture into responsive design, and WordPress, for its company website, we created an adaptive site by incorporating the company's Device Detection product to make server-side decisions such as: whether users should receive SVGs, PNGs or <code>filter</code>ed PNGs; whether to link the company's telephone number, and which telephone number to link to, based on geographic location; which video format and quality to offer based on the user's bandwidth; what size images to embed into the page based on the user's screensize; and apply device-specific CSS and JS fixes based on the data-attributes we added to the <code>html</code> element.<br>

Once inside, you can see not only the power of the Netbiscuits Analytics product, but also the dynamic SVG charts and interactivity that was created to allow our customers to see who their visitors are, what device, OS, browser and version they used, where and when they visited their site, what they did while they were there, and more:<br>

						<h3>Internal Account Management portal:</h3>
						<p>
							<em>This site does require that you create an account; it is free and quick to do so</em>.  To allow our customers to create and maintain their own account users, profiles, settings and code bases, we created a customer-facing account management portal.  Based in Thymeleaf and using Bootstrap for quick stand-up, customers can: create accounts; add users; set authorization levels; upgrade their accounts, including payment; configure and customize their tracking code; and gain access to, and copy, their customized tracking code base:<br>

						<h3>Tablet-optimized website:</h3>
						<p>
							A new version of People.com, optimized for touch-devices, including page-like sections, swiping from section-to-section, interactive content, rich media, and curated search.  The goal of this is to improve the user experience on touch devices and hopefully integrate such interactivity in the full website.<br>

						<h3>2011 Academy Awards interactive second-screen trivia game:</h3>
						<p>
							During the Awards show, users on their tablet device would received "Fun Facts" and trivia questions in-synch with the show, as it happened.  The goal was to improve brand exposure and increase user-base tie-in with event.  Traffic was fair, but suffered from the limited browser scope; functionality has since been added to open it to all browsers.<br>
							Site is visible only during event, link to my version of JS:<br>

						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Photo gallery "Ajaxification":</h3>
						<p>
							Converted page-refresh gallery into Ajax-refreshed gallery. The goal was to increase page views and improve user experience.  This project has been dramatically successful, increasing page views by a whopping 40%, and has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.<br>

							<li>Dynamic recirc, ad and tracking loading and refreshing</li>

The goal was to improve user immersion and, with limited editorial use, it has been successful.  This work has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.
							Custom CMS is behind log-in, link to example use and JS:

							<li>Ajax image from specific slide, displaying in-page</li>
							<li>Staff can drag over image to create hot-spot</li>
							<li>Then enter content for that hot-spot to reveal, such as headline, deck, and image URLs</li>
							<li>Clicking Save creates JSON/P file on server</li>
							<li>Above gallery JS fetches JSON/P and adds interactivity to page</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Photo gallery "stitching":</h3>
						<p>
							Allows editorial staff to "stitch together" several galleries, so, as a user gets to the end of one gallery, the "Next" button takes them straight to another editorially-associated gallery.  The goal was to increase page views and improve user immersion.  This work is used frequently and has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.<br>
							Example: Stitching changes regularly, no consistent example URL<br>
							JSON/P: (no longer available)<br>
							JS: (no longer available)
						</p>

						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Twitter widget:</h3>
						<p>
							Dynamic widget that can be placed on any page, fed various feed parameters, and display the desired number of tweets from various people followed by People.com.  To get around Twitter's max-hits-per-hour, created an in-house fetch-and-cache system (details below).  The goal was to increase user immersion.  This widget has been successful and has since been adopted by other Time, Inc. sites.<br>
							JSON/P: (no longer available)<br>
							JS: (no longer available)

							<li>JSON/P files are cached every 10-15 minutes from WordPress onto People.com servers</li>
							<li>Cached JSON/P files are Ajaxed into page</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>Performance optimizations and site enhancements:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Added HTML5 Boilerplate recommendations, where possible
								<ul>
									<li>HTML5 DOCTYPE</li>
									<li>IE-Conditional Comments around <code>html</code></li>
									<li>Custom Modernizr</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

									<li>Replaced numerous images with CSS3 declarations, retaining image declarations for fallback</li>
									<li>Converted numerous images to sprites, storing as PNG8s</li>
									<li>Converted existing GIF sprites to PNG8s</li>
								</ul>
								Sample Results:
								<ul>
									<li>Reduced Global CSS file size from 70.3kb to 19.6kb</li>
									<li>Reduced Home-page CSS file size from 43.4kb to 26.4kb</li>

								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>UX Test Kitchen: (website no longer available)</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><em>The site is currently replaced with a flat welcome page.</em><br/>
					As co-founder and co-director, I helped with the UX and UI design, then implemented that design into a WordPress theme to create a very un-blog-like website.  The innovative top navigation has won awards, as have some of our clients.
						<ul>
							<li>Combined all JS files, including jQuery &amp; Lightbox, to minimize HTTP Requests</li>
							<li>Used WordPress to aid with content management</li>
							<li>Converted pre-existing site to include HTML5 Boilerplate recommendations where applicable</li>
							<li>Set-up delay on navigation animation instantiation, planting cookies to avoid repeat of animation on subsequent pages</li>
							<li>Navigation animation swaps partially transparent PNGs and uses jQuery animation to adjust size and position on page</li>
							<li>Integration with PayPal to accept donations</li>
							<li>Added Microformats for Staff pages</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Orphaned Starfish: (website no longer available)</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><em>This site has been completely rewritten and currently only contains design elements from the UX Test Kitchen's work.</em><br/>
					A UX Test Kitchen client, this award-winning site is one of my most treasured productions.  Not only is the client's cause a fantastic one, but it is a client that I wasn't able to help during a college course, and, well, it's just an absolutely gorgeous site.  The "hero area" slideshows absolutely fascinate me each time I look at them, with the incredible photos our photographer was able to capture, and the stories that go along with each...
						<ul>
							<li>Incorporate all JS into single file, including jQuery and Google Analytics, to reduce HTTP Requests</li>
							<li>Object-oriented JS</li>
							<li>jQuery</li>
							<li>Used WordPress to aid with content management</li>
							<li>Implemented several HTML5 Boilerplate recommendations</li>
