HOW?

	Matches the exact file
		js/app.js
	Matches all files ending in .js in the js directory only
		js/*.js
	Matches all files ending in .js in the js directory and all child directories
		js/**/*.js
	Excludes js/app.js from the match, which is useful if you want to match all files in a directory except for a particular file
		!js/app.js
	Matches all files in the root directory ending in .js or .css
		*.+(js|css)
	directory 'js',
	some min, some not,
	minify the files that aren’t already minified
		gulp.src(['js/**/*.js', '!js/**/*.min.js'])
	A task may also be a list of other tasks (run async)
		gulp.task('build', ['css', 'js', 'imgs']);
